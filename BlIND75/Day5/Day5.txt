so today is day05 of blind75 i have been consistent on the dsa sheet so today solved are of 3 problems

[1]missing Number

example=[0,2,3,4,5,6,7]
output=1

use a single loop over arrays and expected=0 and sum=0  and also the just create the arrays where expected will 
be n*(n+1)/2 and for the number of arrays we calcuate the sum using sum=sum+nums[i]  and do the difference of expected-sum


[2]longest substring

example:abcdba
output=4

use of hashmap and also one loop and using of put and max function 

[3]group anagram

example=['eat,'tan','ate','ate','nat','bat]
output=[['bat],['nat','tan'],['ate','tea','eat']]

usage of hashmap and also stringlist for the seperate words grouping
