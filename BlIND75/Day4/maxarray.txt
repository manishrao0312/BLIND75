[1]maxSubArray

ex:[1,2,0,-1,4,5]
output=9

we r using just normal array logic not any Approach like the Two pointer Approach or any hashmap
so this is just initilazing the currentsum and maxsum to the first element and then we use the for 
loop to loop from 1th index and loop till the end of the string and then also we inside the loop
we calculate the currentsum by using the max function and do max of(nums[i],currentsum+nums[i])
and next is we calculate maxsum which we also use the max function and do the max of
(currentsum,maxsum) and then we return the max sum
