[1]maxSubArray

ex:[1,2,0,-1,4,5]
output=9

we r using just normal array logic not any Approach like the Two pointer Approach or any hashmap
so this is just initilazing the currentsum and maxsum to the first element and then we use the for 
loop to loop from 1th index and loop till the end of the string and then also we inside the loop
we calculate the currentsum by using the max function and do max of(nums[i],currentsum+nums[i])
and next is we calculate maxsum which we also use the max function and do the max of
(currentsum,maxsum) and then we return the max sum

[2]product except self

this also involves basic array no use of two pointers or hashmap we decalre a new array and then loop
and then loop around the given nums array and then store it and then we do it first we iterate on the left
and then we iterate on right
