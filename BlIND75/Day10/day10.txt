so i did the problem o 3rd february but didnt git pushed it 

[1]reverse bits
ex:12345678
output:1912276176

initilaize a variable called as a result to store the reverse of the given bits and then loop over
the converted bits amd of last bit is 0 and then then store 0 and if 1 then store 1

[2]number of 1 bits

same a sthe above logic 


Note:the notebale part of the above 2 problems is we r using the concept of shfiting which is done
using the   N>>>1 which means shift left
